Pang-Game
Unity Version: Unity 2019.4.20f1

** Extra Credit Implemented **

1. Architecture designed with MVC paradigm +++
2. Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty +++
3. Custom soundtracks and SFX

Reason(s):
1. Creating games should at least follow a certain game design pattern to ensure its flexibility to change.
2. It should be open for game designer to tweak its difficulty and have an easy way to input data and output it when needed.
3. Audio is one of the way for the game to communicate to the player. It serves as a cue or a reason for the player to keep playing. Reference from the audio will be written below to the references.

** Extra Credit NOT Implemented **

1. Custom visuals and shaders ++
2. Two-player, same screen local multiplayer ++
3. Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game +

Reason(s):

1. I highly want to implement some shader for the game. I'm very eager to learn it but, due to time-constraint and lack of knowledge, this technical game doesn't have any.
2. My skill for local multiplayer is still poor but, open for improvement.
3. I also want to implement a leaderboard but, due also to time-constraint. I implemented a score and high score (saving locally) instead.

** Design Changes from the Original Game **

1. The ball bounces differently from the original game (Reference: Arkanoid Game)
2. When a ball touches the player in its invicible mode, it will destroy the ball. The invicible mode last based on its duration value
3. No Timer
4. The Dynamite/PopBalls only pops one once instead of going to its smallest state
